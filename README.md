# RMIT-Business-Analytics-Project-Retail-Transaction-Loyalty-Analysis

**Retail Transaction & Customer Loyalty Analysis**

**Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end business analytics and data validation workflow using retail transaction data. The objective was to clean, validate, and transform raw transactional records into accurate business-level metrics that support operational analysis and decision-making.

The project focuses on data integrity, business logic validation, and insight generation, aligning closely with responsibilities in Business Analysis, QA/UAT, Systems Analysis, and Operations roles.

**Business Objectives**
- The analysis was designed to address common business questions, including:
- How revenue trends change over time (monthly performance)
- How average order value (AOV) differs across customer segments
- How customer loyalty impacts revenue contribution
- Whether transactional data can be reliably transformed into business metrics

**Scope of Work**
- Cleaned and validated raw retail transaction data for accuracy and consistency
- Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardised date fields
- Transformed line-item transactions into order-level and monthly metrics
- Segmented customers based on purchasing behaviour to analyse loyalty patterns
- Produced clear, business-ready summaries and visualisations for stakeholders

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- CSV data processing
- Data validation and exploratory analysis techniques

**Key Outcomes**
- Validated and processed 77,000+ transaction records
- Generated reliable order-level metrics including revenue and AOV
- Identified differences in revenue contribution across customer loyalty segments
- Delivered insights suitable for business review, system validation, and reporting
- Professional Relevance
